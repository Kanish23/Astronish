        <p class="section-intro">Spectroscopy is one of those topics which may seem random, but it is actually very important. By determining the chemical compositoon of a planet through light, we can predict various things such as if life exists. In this sectiosn you will go through common spectroscopy topics such as electromagnetism.</p>

                    In astrophysics, electromagnetism plays a critical role in the behavior of charged particles in space plasmas, the propagation of electromagnetic radiation across the cosmos, and the structure of magnetic fields around planets, stars, and galaxies.
For instance, the Sun’s magnetic field shapes solar winds and drives solar flares, which can influence space weather and impact satellite operations on Earth. Electromagnetic radiation, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays, is the primary medium through which astronomers observe and analyze distant celestial objects. By studying this radiation’s spectrum, polarization, and intensity, scientists infer the physical properties, composition, and motions of stars and galaxies.
Moreover, electromagnetism underlies the operation of many essential instruments in astronomy, such as radio telescopes, spectrometers, and charged particle detectors. It also forms the theoretical basis for modern technologies like MRI machines and particle accelerators.
Understanding electromagnetism is fundamental to grasping how energy and information travel through the universe and how charged matter interacts on both microscopic and cosmic scales.

                 Spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used to study the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. In astronomy, it serves as a fundamental tool for understanding the composition, temperature, density, motion, and physical properties of celestial objects.
When light from a star, galaxy, or other astronomical source passes through a prism or diffraction grating, it splits into a spectrum of colors or wavelengths. This spectrum contains characteristic lines—either emission or absorption—that correspond to specific atomic or molecular transitions. Each element produces a unique spectral fingerprint, allowing astronomers to identify the chemical makeup of distant stars and interstellar matter.
Spectroscopy enables measurement of Doppler shifts in spectral lines, providing insights into the radial velocity of objects. This helps determine if a star is moving toward or away from Earth, revealing information about stellar motion, galaxy rotation, and the expansion of the universe.
Moreover, the intensity and width of spectral lines convey physical conditions like temperature, pressure, and magnetic fields in stellar atmospheres or gas clouds. Through techniques such as emission line analysis and absorption spectroscopy, astronomers can infer the presence of elements, ionization states, and molecular compounds.
In sum, spectroscopy transforms light into a detailed narrative about the universe’s composition and dynamics, bridging the gap between observational data and theoretical astrophysics.
