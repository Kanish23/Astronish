        <p class="section-intro">When moving into higher levels of astronomy, astronomers tend to use more sophisticated
            systems to communicate the position of a certain star in a certain moment. In this section, you are going to
            read about multiple different ways to point out where a star is in the sky.</p>

                <p class="subtext">
                    Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) make up the equatorial coordinate system, which is used
                    to map the sky much like latitude and longitude are used to map Earth.
                    This system is centered on the celestial sphere, an imaginary globe surrounding Earth where all
                    celestial bodies appear to lie.
                    Right Ascension (RA) measures the object's position eastward along the celestial equator, in units
                    of hours, minutes, and seconds, ranging from 0h to 24h.
                    One hour equals 15 degrees of arc because Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours. Declination (Dec) measures
                    how far north or south an object is from the celestial equator, in degrees, ranging from +90° at the
                    celestial north pole to -90° at the south pole.
                    Using RA and Dec allows astronomers anywhere on Earth to locate celestial objects with high
                    precision, regardless of their current position or time, as long as the object is above the horizon.

                <h2 class="subheader">Altitude and Azimuth</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    The horizontal coordinate system (or Alt-Az system) describes a celestial object's position relative
                    to an observer's horizon and is more intuitive for beginners.
                    Altitude is the vertical angle between an object and the horizon. It ranges from 0° (on the horizon)
                    to 90° (directly overhead at the zenith). Azimuth is the compass direction along the horizon from
                    the observer's north, measured in degrees from 0° to 360°.
                    For example, due east is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°. Since Alt-Az coordinates are based on
                    your specific time and location, they change constantly as the Earth rotates.
                    Tools like planetarium apps or go-to mounts can help track this dynamic system in real time, making
                    it particularly useful for visual observation or telescope alignment.

                <h2 class="subheader">How to switch between them</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Converting between the Alt-Az system and RA-Dec requires knowledge of your geographic coordinates
                    (latitude and longitude), the local sidereal time, and the current date and time.
                    This is because: RA and Dec are fixed coordinates (based on the stars’ positions in the sky).
                    Altitude and Azimuth are dynamic, changing as the Earth rotates.
                    The conversion involves complex trigonometric formulas, but most modern telescope software, star
                    trackers, or apps handle this automatically.
                    Understanding this conversion is crucial when using a telescope with equatorial mounts or planning
                    long-term observations of objects that appear only at certain times or locations in the sky.

                <h2 class="subheader">Why even use Right Ascencion and Declination?</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    In astronomy, the precise determination of the positions of celestial objects is fundamental for
                    observation, navigation, and astrophysical research. To achieve this, astronomers use a celestial
                    coordinate system analogous to the geographic coordinate system used on Earth. Right Ascension (RA)
                    and Declination (Dec) are the two key angular measurements that define this system, enabling the
                    accurate and consistent specification of locations on the celestial sphere.
                    Declination is the angular distance of an object north or south of the celestial equator, measured
                    in degrees. It is analogous to terrestrial latitude and ranges from +90° at the celestial north pole
                    to -90° at the celestial south pole. Declination provides a fixed frame of reference that helps in
                    determining how far above or below the celestial equator a star or other object lies.
                    Right Ascension, on the other hand, measures the angular distance of an object eastward along the
                    celestial equator from the vernal equinox — the point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator at
                    the March equinox. Unlike terrestrial longitude, RA is expressed in units of time (hours, minutes,
                    and seconds), reflecting the Earth’s rotation: 24 hours corresponds to a full 360° rotation. This
                    time-based measurement allows astronomers to predict when a celestial object will cross a given
                    meridian, which is crucial for scheduling observations.
                    The combination of RA and Dec establishes a spherical coordinate system fixed relative to the stars,
                    independent of the observer’s location on Earth. This is essential because the Earth rotates and
                    orbits the Sun, causing apparent motion of celestial objects in the sky. Using RA and Dec provides a
                    stable celestial reference frame known as the equatorial coordinate system, facilitating accurate
                    tracking and cataloging of objects over time.
                    Moreover, the equatorial coordinate system supports conversions to other systems like the horizontal
                    coordinate system (altitude and azimuth), which depend on the observer’s location and time. This
                    flexibility enables astronomers to translate the fixed celestial coordinates into practical angles
                    for telescopes and navigation.
                    In summary, Right Ascension and Declination are fundamental because they provide a standardized,
                    time-independent framework to locate celestial bodies precisely on the celestial sphere, enabling
                    consistent observations, navigation, and astrophysical analysis across the global scientific
                    community.

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2 class="subheader">Parallax</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Parallax is a fundamental observational technique used in astronomy to determine the distances to
                    nearby celestial objects, primarily stars, by exploiting the apparent shift in position of an object
                    when observed from different vantage points. It serves as the foundation of the cosmic distance
                    ladder, enabling astronomers to calibrate other indirect methods of distance measurement.
                    The principle of parallax relies on geometry: as the Earth orbits the Sun, the observer’s viewpoint
                    changes. By measuring the apparent displacement of a star against the backdrop of more distant,
                    essentially fixed stars at two opposite points in Earth’s orbit (typically six months apart),
                    astronomers can calculate the angle of this apparent shift — called the parallax angle. This angle
                    is extremely small, usually measured in arcseconds.
                    Expressed as d = 1/p
                    This direct relationship allows precise computation of stellar distances up to a few thousand
                    light-years with modern instrumentation.
                    Parallax is crucial because it provides a geometrically direct and assumption-free measurement of
                    stellar distances, unlike other methods which depend on models or indirect indicators such as
                    brightness or redshift. Establishing accurate distances enables astronomers to calculate intrinsic
                    properties of stars, including their absolute luminosity, size, and mass, which are essential for
                    understanding stellar evolution.
                    Furthermore, parallax measurements anchor the distance scale of the universe. Once distances to
                    nearby stars are known precisely, these calibrations allow for the validation and refinement of
                    secondary distance indicators — such as Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae — which extend
                    distance measurements to galaxies millions of light-years away.
                    Technological advances, such as the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, have revolutionized
                    parallax measurements by providing extremely precise astrometry for over a billion stars, pushing
                    the limits of this method’s reach and accuracy.
                    In conclusion, parallax is indispensable in astronomy as the most fundamental and reliable technique
                    for measuring stellar distances, forming the basis for understanding the scale and structure of the
                    cosmos.
