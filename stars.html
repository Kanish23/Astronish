                <p class="subtext">
			Some stars stand out not just for their brightness but also for their historical, cultural, or scientific significance. These famous stars are often used as reference points in the night sky:
Sirius – The brightest star in Earth’s night sky, located in the constellation Canis Major. It's a binary system, with a white dwarf companion.
Betelgeuse – A red supergiant in Orion, famous for its immense size and brightness. It’s nearing the end of its life and may go supernova within the next million years.
Polaris – Also known as the North Star, it's nearly aligned with Earth's rotational axis, making it a reliable guide for navigation.
Vega – A bright star in the constellation Lyra, used in calibrating astronomical measurements.
Alpha Centauri – The closest star system to Earth (besides the Sun), consisting of three stars, including Proxima Centauri, which hosts exoplanets.
These stars are prominent in myths, navigation, science, and our understanding of stellar evolution.

                <h2 class="subheader">Types of Stars</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
		Stars come in a wide variety of types, classified by their mass, temperature, and evolutionary stage. The most common classification system is based on spectral type: O, B, A, F, G, K, M, from hottest (O-type, blue) to coolest (M-type, red).
Key types include:
Main Sequence Stars – Like our Sun (a G-type star), these are in the stable phase of converting hydrogen to helium.
Giant and Supergiant Stars – Evolved, massive stars that have expanded and burn heavier elements.
White Dwarfs – The hot, dense remnants of low to medium-mass stars after they’ve shed their outer layers.
Neutron Stars – Extremely dense cores left after supernova explosions of massive stars; some become pulsars.
Brown Dwarfs – Substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion.
Variable Stars – Stars whose brightness changes due to internal or external processes (e.g., Cepheids or eclipsing binaries).
This classification helps astronomers predict a star’s behavior, lifecycle, and potential for hosting planets.

                <h2 class="subheader">Lifespan of a Star</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
		A star’s lifespan is primarily determined by its mass. The more massive a star is, the shorter its life:
Massive stars (like O- or B-types) burn their fuel quickly and may only live for a few million years.
Sun-like stars live around 10 billion years, spending most of their time on the main sequence.
Low-mass red dwarfs (M-type stars) burn fuel slowly and can live for hundreds of billions to trillions of years—longer than the current age of the universe!
After the main sequence phase, a star evolves through stages like red giant, planetary nebula, or supernova, depending on its mass, eventually becoming a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.
