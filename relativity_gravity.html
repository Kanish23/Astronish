        <p class="section-intro">it's difficult to grasp as to why this happens, but gravity is a force we are
            constantly experiencing. Feeling 0 gravity will likely not be experienced by humanity for quite some time.
            In this section, we go over some concepts with gravity.</p>

                <h2 class="subheader">The Curvature of Spacetime and Gravity</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    In Newtonian physics, gravity is described as a force pulling objects toward each other. However,
                    Einstein’s general relativity gives us a deeper understanding: gravity is not really a force but a
                    consequence of how mass and energy bend the fabric of spacetime.
                    Spacetime is a four-dimensional continuum combining the three dimensions of space and one dimension
                    of time. Massive objects like stars, planets, and black holes cause this fabric to curve around
                    them. Imagine placing a heavy ball on a stretched rubber sheet—the ball creates a dip or well in the
                    sheet. Smaller objects nearby will move toward the heavy ball, not because they are pulled by a
                    force directly, but because they are following the curved paths created by the dip in the sheet.
                    This curvature affects the motion of objects and even the flow of time. Objects move along paths
                    called geodesics, which are the "straightest possible" paths in curved spacetime. What we perceive
                    as gravitational attraction is actually objects moving along these curved geodesics.
                    Thus, gravity is the manifestation of curved spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy,
                    fundamentally changing how we understand the interaction between matter and space.

                <h2 class="subheader">Black Holes and Event Horizons</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Black holes are among the most fascinating predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
                    According to this theory, massive objects cause a curvature in the fabric of spacetime. When a star
                    with enough mass exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can undergo gravitational collapse, compressing its
                    mass into an incredibly small region. This intense concentration of mass bends spacetime so severely
                    that it creates a region from which nothing—not even light—can escape. This region is called a black
                    hole.
                    At the boundary surrounding a black hole lies the event horizon. This is the point of no return:
                    once anything crosses the event horizon, it cannot escape the black hole’s gravitational pull. The
                    event horizon is not a physical surface but rather a mathematical boundary in spacetime. Its size
                    depends on the black hole’s mass, described by the Schwarzschild radius for non-rotating black
                    holes.
                    Black holes dramatically demonstrate the effects of gravity predicted by general relativity. They
                    warp time and space so extremely that time appears to slow down near the event horizon relative to
                    an outside observer, a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation.
                    Studying black holes and their event horizons helps physicists explore the nature of gravity under
                    extreme conditions and probes the interface between general relativity and quantum mechanics,
                    shedding light on fundamental questions about the universe.
