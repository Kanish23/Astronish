                <p class="subtext">
                    Newton’s First Law states that an object will maintain its state of rest or uniform linear motion unless acted upon by a net external force. This principle, often called the law of inertia, establishes the fundamental concept of force and motion equilibrium.
In an astronomical context, this law explains why celestial bodies such as planets, stars, and spacecraft continue to move through the vacuum of space along predictable trajectories without continuous propulsion. Since space is nearly devoid of friction or resistance, once an object is set in motion, it will keep moving in a straight line at constant velocity unless gravitational forces or collisions alter its path.
This law provides the foundation for understanding orbital mechanics, where the gravitational pull of massive bodies acts as the external force that changes the motion of orbiting objects. It also underlies inertial reference frames, essential in describing the motion of objects in classical mechanics.

                <h2 class="subheader">Newton: 2nd Law</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                   Newton’s Second Law quantitatively relates the net force applied to an object to its acceleration, formalized as: F = ma.
                    where F is the net external force, m is the mass of the object, and a is the resulting acceleration.
This law provides the mathematical framework to predict how an object’s velocity changes in response to forces acting upon it. In astrophysics, it governs the dynamics of bodies under gravitational attraction, propulsion forces in spacecraft maneuvers, and interactions during collisions or close encounters.
For example, calculating the acceleration of a planet in orbit around a star requires knowing the gravitational force acting on it. The second law then allows determination of the planet’s orbital velocity and trajectory, fundamental for mission planning and understanding celestial mechanics.
It also explains why more massive objects require larger forces to change their motion, a critical concept when considering the inertia of massive astronomical bodies.

                <h2 class="subheader">Newton: 3rd Law</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Newton’s Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means forces always occur in pairs: if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on object A.
This law is crucial in understanding the mutual gravitational attraction between celestial bodies. When the Earth exerts a gravitational force on the Moon, the Moon exerts an equal and opposite force on the Earth, resulting in their orbital dance around a common center of mass.
It also underpins propulsion systems used in space exploration. Rocket engines expel exhaust gases backward, and in reaction, the rocket is propelled forward. This principle allows spacecraft to maneuver in the frictionless vacuum of space without needing external push.
Newton’s Third Law enforces the conservation of momentum and is fundamental to the dynamics of multi-body systems, collisions, and interactions throughout the universe.
