        <p class="section-intro">Although niche, cosmology contains some verry important topics relating to our universe. You need it to understand how it all began, and the tools we use to try to understand what was at the beginning. In this section, we will look at things such as the Big Bang Theory!</p>

                <p class="subtext">
                    The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for how the universe began. According to this theory, the universe started around 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense, and compact point called a singularity. It wasn’t an explosion in space, but rather an expansion of space itself.
In the first few moments, the universe rapidly expanded and cooled, allowing subatomic particles to form, followed by atoms. Over millions of years, gravity pulled matter together to form stars, galaxies, and eventually galaxy clusters. The Big Bang theory is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including the expanding universe (Hubble’s Law), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium.

                <h2 class="subheader">Cosmic Microwave Background</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    The Cosmic Microwave Background is the faint glow of radiation left over from the Big Bang. It’s essentially the oldest light in the universe, dating back to about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled enough for atoms to form and light to travel freely through space.
Discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, the CMB is incredibly uniform but contains tiny fluctuations—ripples that represent the earliest seeds of galaxies. These fluctuations help scientists understand the universe's composition, age, and structure. Today, we detect the CMB as microwave radiation, and satellites like COBE, WMAP, and Planck have mapped it in great detail.

                <h2 class="subheader">Age of the Universe</h2>
                <p class="subtext">
                    The universe is currently estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old. This value has been determined using multiple methods, including:
Observing the CMB – Fluctuations in the microwave background provide detailed information about the universe’s expansion history.
Measuring the Hubble constant – The rate at which the universe expands gives a timeline for how long it has been expanding.
Studying the oldest stars and globular clusters – These ancient stellar populations serve as cosmic time markers.
The combination of these methods, especially refined data from the Planck satellite, gives us a highly precise age estimate. Understanding the universe’s age helps astronomers place cosmic events—like galaxy formation and star evolution—into a clear timeline.
