                <p class="subtext">
                    Kepler’s First Law states that the orbit of every planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun
                    located at one of the two foci of the ellipse. This was a revolutionary idea because, before Kepler,
                    it was commonly believed that planetary orbits were perfect circles.
                    An ellipse is an oval-shaped curve defined by two focal points (foci). The sum of the distances from
                    any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. In the case of planetary orbits, the Sun
                    occupies one focus, and the planet moves along the ellipse around it.
                    This law explains why the distance between a planet and the Sun changes as the planet moves along
                    its orbit — sometimes it’s closer (perihelion) and sometimes it’s farther (aphelion). This varying
                    distance affects the planet’s orbital speed and other properties of its motion.
                    Kepler’s First Law laid the foundation for understanding planetary motion and helped Newton later
                    develop his law of universal gravitation.

                <p class="subtext">
                    Kepler’s Second Law states that a line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas
                    during equal intervals of time. In other words, the planet moves in such a way that the area covered
                    by the line connecting it to the Sun is the same over any given time period.
                    What this means practically is that a planet travels faster when it is closer to the Sun (at
                    perihelion) and slower when it is farther from the Sun (at aphelion). Because the area swept out in
                    a given time is constant, when the planet is near the Sun, it covers more distance along its orbit,
                    and when it is farther, it covers less distance.
                    This law reflects the conservation of angular momentum in the planet-Sun system — as the planet
                    moves closer to the Sun, its orbital velocity increases to conserve angular momentum, and vice
                    versa.
                    Kepler’s Second Law was a major step forward in understanding the dynamics of planetary motion and
                    laid important groundwork for Newton’s theory of gravitation.

                <p class="subtext">
                    Kepler’s Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (the time a planet takes to complete
                    one orbit around the Sun) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (the average
                    distance between the planet and the Sun).
                    This means that planets that are farther away from the Sun take much longer to complete an orbit
                    compared to planets that are closer.
                    Kepler’s Third Law provided a precise mathematical relationship linking the size of a planet’s orbit
                    to its orbital period, allowing astronomers to predict planetary positions and orbital speeds with
                    great accuracy. It also paved the way for Newton’s law of universal gravitation by showing that the
                    force keeping planets in orbit decreases with distance.
