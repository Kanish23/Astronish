        <h1 class="section-title">Stellar Properties</h1>
        <p class="section-intro">Stellar properties refer to the fundamental characteristics of stars that help astronomers understand their nature, life cycle, and behavior. These include attributes such as luminosity, temperature, mass, radius, composition, and age. By studying these properties through observations and models, scientists can classify stars, trace their evolutionary paths, and gain insight into the processes governing stellar formation and death. Understanding stellar properties is essential for unlocking the broader mysteries of galaxies and the universe.</p>

                <p class="subtext">
                  Luminosity is a fundamental property of stars that represents the total amount of energy emitted by a star every second across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike apparent brightness, which depends on the observer's distance from the star, luminosity is an intrinsic characteristic‚Äîmeaning it reflects the star‚Äôs true energy output regardless of how far it is from Earth. It is typically measured in watts (joules per second) or in terms of the Sun‚Äôs luminosity (ùêø‚äô) as a reference point. Similarly, larger stars with greater surface areas emit more total energy, making them more luminous.
Luminosity plays a crucial role in astrophysics because it allows astronomers to determine many other important stellar properties. By comparing a star‚Äôs luminosity with its apparent brightness, scientists can calculate its distance through the inverse square law of light. Moreover, luminosity combined with temperature helps classify stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which reveals their evolutionary stage‚Äîsuch as whether a star is on the main sequence, a giant, or a white dwarf.
In summary, luminosity is essential for understanding not only the physical characteristics of stars but also the structure and evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.

                <p class="subtext">
                 The life cycle of a star is a complex and fascinating process that spans millions to billions of years, involving various stages from birth to death, determined largely by the star‚Äôs initial mass.
Stellar Nebula
Stars begin their lives in vast clouds of gas and dust called stellar nebulae. Gravity causes regions within these clouds to collapse and condense, forming dense cores. As the material contracts, it heats up, eventually creating a protostar.
Protostar
A protostar is a young, forming star still gathering mass from its surroundings. It emits primarily infrared radiation as it heats up but hasn‚Äôt yet begun nuclear fusion in its core. When the temperature and pressure in the core become sufficiently high, nuclear fusion ignites.
Main Sequence
Once nuclear fusion starts, converting hydrogen into helium, the star enters the main sequence phase. This is the longest, most stable period in a star‚Äôs life where it generates energy steadily. The star‚Äôs luminosity, temperature, and size remain relatively constant. The star‚Äôs mass determines its exact position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram during this phase. Our Sun is currently in its main sequence stage.
Red Giant or Supergia
After the hydrogen in the core is depleted, fusion slows and the core contracts, heating the surrounding layers. The outer layers expand and cool, turning the star into a red giant (for medium-sized stars) or a red supergiant (for massive stars). In these stages, the star begins fusing heavier elements like helium, carbon, and oxygen.
Stellar Death: White Dwarf, Neutron Star, or Black Hole
The final fate of the star depends on its mass:
Low to medium mass stars (like the Sun) shed their outer layers, creating a planetary nebula, and leave behind a dense, hot core called a white dwarf. White dwarfs gradually cool and fade over time.
Massive stars undergo more dramatic deaths. When their cores collapse under gravity, they explode in a supernova, scattering elements into space. The remnant core becomes either a neutron star or, if massive enough, collapses further into a black hole.
Recycling of Materia
The elements ejected by stars during their death enrich the interstellar medium, contributing to the formation of new stars and planets, continuing the cosmic cycle of matter.
